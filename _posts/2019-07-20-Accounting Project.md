<font face="Times New Roman">
This semester is quite busy for me because apart from backend development learning, I also have three accounting research projects at the same time. Now, since most of research projects have completed, I want to sort out all my current individual and group research accounting projects, maybe I will add more in my further studying.  <br> 

Accounting is a subjective discipline. Compared with traditional accounting, t seems most of my friends prefer to choose consulting. For me, accounting is a tool (or skill). I'm not sure whether I will be able to a eligible accountant in the future. But maybe I need to pass CPA exams at first and then consider later things. </font>
